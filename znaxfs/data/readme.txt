Znax GP2X SDL2 Version
----------------------

What is it
----------
Znax is a remake of a game by Nick Kouvaris (http://lightforce.freestuff.gr).
It is a sort of puzzle / arcade game where you as the player need to select 
4 blocks of the same color and form rectangles as big as you can. By doing 
this you will erase all blocks in this square and they will be replaced by 
new blocks. You keep on doing this till the time runs out, and try to gain 
your highest score possible. There are two game modes, Relative timer and 
fixed Timer, in the first mode you'll also gain extra time for deleting 
blocks so you can play longer if you are fast enough. With the second mode 
you don't get extra time for deleting blocks but just points added to your 
score so here you try to get the highest amount of points in the given time 
period. The game Has support for up to 25 additional mod music files 
and skin support !
